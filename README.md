# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Basic
My first project with Python. We aim to investigate the variables correlating to the highest ratings for downloaded apps on the Google Play Store.
We then use multiple linear regression to determine relationships and confounding variables, accounting for interaction effects and model assessment such as R2, ultimately evaluating our model assumptions and error minimization technique.
